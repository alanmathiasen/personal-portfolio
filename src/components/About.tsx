    <p className="text-xl">
      I am a highly motivated Junior Full Stack Developer with experience in the MERN stack
      (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). My journey as a self-taught coder started at the
      start of 2021. Since then, I have been dedicated to developing my skills and building projects
      that not only meet but exceed the expectations of the end-user. I pride myself on my ability
      to work both independently and as part of a team, and I have experience working with Agile
      development methodologies. I am always seeking to improve my skills through self-learning and
      attending workshops and events. I am an avid learner, and I am always looking for new
      technologies and methodologies to improve my skills.
